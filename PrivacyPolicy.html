<h2 class="w3-dark-grey">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="w3-light-grey">As of 8/5/2023 Any apps released by Watson Interfacing and their singular employee, me, Will not collect your data in any way, we will not use any data that we don't collect for any reason whatsoever. Usage and download data MAY be collected by the microsoft app store (and any other platform's app store) but that is not a function of my app(s) nor will it ever be in the foreseeable future. If i learn how to push update popups in new versions, you will recieve a popup if this privacy policy ever changes, which is unlikely as Watson Interfacing is a "stage" name and not an official entity. Thank you.</p>
